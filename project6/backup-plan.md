# Brandon's Backup Methods
## Describe how you currently maintain backups of your work and files important to you. Be honest. There are still things to be learned if you aren't currently doing anything.  
1)  Currently, my system for backing up files and documents all rely (mainly) on manually copying files into flash drives and folders that are automatically backed up into a Google Drive.  
## What redundancy does your method provide?  
2)  The system I use creates redundancy not only in the method itself, but the maintaining the files in such a fashion that multiple copies exist.  
## Are you backing up your operating system, or just files within?  
3)  Mainly backing up files and not the actual OS image.  
## What core programs do you use?  
4)  GitHub for programming work, Google Drive for course work, flash drives for personal work, Social Media for photos (mainly)  
## How long would it take to get back up and running if your system died tomorrow?  
5)  I have recently transfered from my PC to a mobile Laptop that took about 3 hours to set up.  The reason for this was that I did not need much of the files on my main PC so I was able to start fresh.  
## Is this time reasonable?  
6)  I would believe 3 hours is a reasonable amount of time to re-download software and games.  
## What improvements can you make to your backup plan?  
7)  I can improve on a system that doesn't rely so much on hard copies.  Even utilizing less flashdrives to help reduce waste would help since I would probably lose the flashdrives in the process of saving documents.
